        <h3>Enjoy The New Challanges Everyday </h3>
        <p>Be a learner, not a student. Life never give you the second chance. So always enjoy the every seconds of life. Always remember that "No body can stop you, only you can stop you." Nothing can be harmful for you, if you are a desparate boy. Not always money make you happy, smartness will make you happy.</p>
